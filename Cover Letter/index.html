				<div id="cover_letter"> 
					<p> I consider myself to be a diligent worker (and student) with a great attention to detail. 
					I am also a fast learner and have an exceptional time management skills. 
					I have experience in working with deadlines and time-pressured environments, 
					which I have proven over the last few years by working at an office administrator position 
					and while doing my English Philology and Production Management and Engineering majors. 
					I enjoy structure but I am also a creative person and I feel like this combination will work well in the IT industry.</p>
					<p>One of my learning and career goals is to be able to help people to cope with 
					technology by making it more approachable, effective and user-friendly, 
					as it has dominated most parts of people’s lives and it will continue to do so. 
					I also feel like IT profession is not a common carrier choice for women in general 
					and hopefully this will change over next few years as it offers many interesting paths and opportunities.
